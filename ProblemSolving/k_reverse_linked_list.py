# K reverse linked list
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/k-reverse-linked-list/
#
# Given a singly linked list and an integer K, reverses the nodes of the
#
# list K at a time and returns modified linked list.
#
#     NOTE : The length of the list is divisible by K
#
# Example :
#
# Given linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 and K=2,
#
# You should return 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5
#
# Try to solve the problem using constant extra space.
