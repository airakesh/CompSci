Use case: For sorting 10 GB of data using only 1 GB of RAM:

1. Read 1 GB of the data in main memory and sort by using quicksort.

2. Write the sorted data to disk.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all of the data is in sorted 1 GB chunks (there are 10 GB / 1 GB = 10 chunks), 
which now need to be merged into one single output file.

4. Read the first 90 MB of each sorted chunk (of 1 GB) into input buffers in main memory and 
allocate the remaining 100 MB for an output buffer.
(For better performance, we can take the output buffer larger and the input buffers slightly smaller.)

5. Perform a 10-way merge and store the result in the output buffer.

6. Whenever the output buffer fills, write it to the final sorted file and empty it.
Whenever any of the 90 MB input buffers empty, fill it with the next 90 MB of its associated 1 GB sorted chunk 
until no more data from the chunk is available.
